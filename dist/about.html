        <p>Hello, my name is Mike Miller and I have been busy. I am the co-founder of Them2 Limited which is an e-commerce company that I started with my wife... no really. Currently, and maybe until I die on Mars, I specialize in front end web developement, particularly JavaScript with React, but have a heart for ALL things tech. Some of my past projects are included in the Work section of this lovely site, so check it out, or else. I graduated from Galvanize's Web Development Immersive course in August 2018, am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science from The University of the People. I dream to be a digital nomad and travel the world my my amazing wife and soon to be three (busy, very busy) intelligent and insightful children, while freelancing & blogging. I am intrinsically motivated to be the best father, employee, and founder. Please do get in touch especially if you’re hiring driven people like myself.”</p>
